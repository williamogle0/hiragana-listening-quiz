# Hiragana Listening Quiz

Requires pygame.
A basic Hiragana Listening quiz, currently set to ta-ho. you put mp3 files of hiragana that you want to test in the sounds folder, and it will pick randomly. I plan to make a gui to choose hiragana, katakana, and possibly even kanji. You have to write it down irl, it just provides you with what to write, if I continue like this, I might make it show the answer.
